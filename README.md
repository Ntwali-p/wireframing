# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified, low-fidelity visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a user interface. Wireframes show layout, structure, and the placement of major elements (navigation, content areas, controls) without focusing on final visual design, colors, or detailed typography.

## Why wireframing is important
- **Clarifies structure early:** Wireframes help designers, product managers, and developers align on information architecture and page structure before committing to visual design or code.
- **Finds usability issues fast:** By focusing on layout and flow, wireframes expose navigation and interaction problems early when they are cheapest to fix.
- **Speeds iteration:** Low-fidelity wireframes are quick to create and modify, enabling more rapid exploration of different ideas and UX flows.
- **Improves communication:** Wireframes act as a common language between stakeholders — designers, developers, and business owners — reducing misunderstandings.
- **Saves time and cost:** Identifying problems and making decisions at the wireframe stage reduces rework later during high-fidelity design or development.

## Common wireframe types
- **Low-fidelity:** Sketches or simple blocks that show layout and basic flow.
- **Mid-fidelity:** Add more detailed structure and some annotations (but still without final visual style).
- **High-fidelity:** Detailed wireframes that include closer-to-final spacing and element behavior (sometimes used as a bridge to prototypes).

## Tools & tips
- **Tools:** pen & paper, Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, Balsamiq, or any whiteboard tool.
- **Tips:** start simple, annotate intentions/behaviors, test flows quickly with stakeholders or users, and iterate.

## Example workflow
1. Sketch rough ideas (paper/whiteboard).
2. Create low-fidelity wireframes for key screens.
3. Review with stakeholders; gather feedback.
4. Convert to mid/high-fidelity wireframes or interactive prototypes.
5. Handoff to designers/developers with annotations and assets.
